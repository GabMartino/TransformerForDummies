## The simplest tokenizer

The vocabulary size can hugely affect the performances of the model and this hugely depends on how we want to create the vocabulary.
To simplify a bit we create our own mapping "word to integer" just considering the lower case words just extracted from the dataset.

### Of course in no-way this is want to be the best approach, built-in tokenizer already exists
This wants to be just an "artigianal" example.
